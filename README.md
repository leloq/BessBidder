**Continuous Intraday Trading: An Open-Source Multi-Market Bidding Framework for Energy Storage Systems**
*by Kim K. Miskiw, Jan Ludwig, Leo Semmelmann, Christof Weinhardt*
Presented at the 15th ACM International Conference on Future Energy Systems (ACM e-Energy 2025), Rotterdam

BessBidder is an open-source framework for modeling and simulating battery energy storage system trading strategies across day-ahead and continuous intraday electricity markets. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to compare different bidding approaches, including myopic and coordinated strategies, using mixed integer linear programming and deep reinforcement learning.

## Setup

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create `.env` file for credentials:

This file manages all access credentials for the database and APIs. Specify them before starting to work with the notebook. A free ENTSO-E API key can be requested at [ENTSO-E Transparency Platform](https://uat-transparency.entsoe.eu/content/static_content/Static%20content/web%20api/how_to_get_security_token.html). *IMPORTANT NOTE*: EPEX Spot data is not open-source and for you to use the notebook, you will have to have bought the data. 

```env
ENTSOE_API_KEY=...
POSTGRES_DB_NAME=...
POSTGRES_DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
POSTGRES_USER=...
EPEX_SFTP_HOST=...
EPEX_SFTP_PORT=...
EPEX_SFTP_USER=...
EPEX_SFTP_PW=...
```

### Define study scope in `config.py`

In this file, you can define technical parameters of the model, the time horizon, and output paths. Please configure these settings before starting data acquisition, as the download depends on your study setup. 

## Database Configuration

To prepare a local PostgreSQL instance:

```sql
CREATE USER elli WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
CREATE DATABASE epex_data;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE epex_data TO elli;
ALTER DATABASE epex_data OWNER TO elli;
```

Edit `pg_hba.conf` to set authentication method to `trust` for local development.

## Data Acquisition

Execute the script `01b_data_acquisition.py` to fill the database with ENTSO-E and EPEX Spot data for the reproduction of the study. Note that the framework allows downloading data for 2019–2023.

Steps:

1. Load ENTSO-E generation/load data
2. Load intraday transaction data (pre/post 2022 formats)

Alternatively, run the scripts in `src/data_acquisition/epex_sftp/` directly.

## Single-Market Bidding

### Day-ahead Market (MILP Benchmark)

Run `02a_single_market_day_ahead_milp.py` to compute benchmark DA bids using MILP.
Results are saved to `output/single_market/day_ahead_milp/`.

### Intraday Market (Rolling Intrinsic)

Run `02b_single_market_rolling_intrinsic_h.py` with CLI arguments:

```bash
python 02b_single_market_rolling_intrinsic_h.py 60 1 1 365 10
```

Logs will be saved in `output/single_market/rolling_intrinsic/ri_basic/`

## Multi-Market Bidding

### Myopic Bidding

Run `03_myopic-multi_market.py` to combine MILP-based DA bidding with rolling intrinsic-based intraday bidding.

### Coordinated Bidding (Deep Reinforcement Learning)

#### Data Preparation

Run `04a_transform_data_for_coordinated_multi_market.py` to add features (e.g. IDFull) and split train/test data.

#### Training

Run `04b_train_coordinated_multi_market.py` to train the PPO agent.
Choose `intraday_product_type='H'` or `'QH'`. Model and tensorboard logs are versioned under `output/coordinated_multi_market/`.

#### Testing

Run `04c_test_coordinated_multi_market.py` to evaluate agent behavior.
This feeds DA decisions into rolling intrinsic logic and outputs test logs and reports.

## Results & Plots

Use the following scripts to create figures and tables:

* `plot_ACMeEnergy_Single_Market.py`
* `plot_ACMeEnergy_Myopic_Multi_Market.py`
* `plot_ACMeEnergy_Coordinated_Multi_Market.py`

Plots are saved in their respective `output` subfolder under `figures`.
